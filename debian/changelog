amount-partition (1.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add 'spent-virtually' concept, see below:
    The idea is that sometimes small enough amount is used for some goal, so
    there is no need for actual "withdrawal"-
    in such cases the user just needs to "remember" to deposit less in the next deposit,
    and use the amount for another goal.
    So adding 'spent-virtually' box implements this idea- if spending is
    marked 'virtual'- the amount is added to this box. Then, on the next
    deposit, if not stated otherwise, the amount is added to 'free'
